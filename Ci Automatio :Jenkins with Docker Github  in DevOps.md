# DevOps Automation With Jenkins, Docker & GitHub
## Introduction 
Competition and market requirements lead to companies
developing large software projects to find higher
competitiveness through shorter development cycles and
lower costs. One way to achieve these goals is through better
automation in the development of software projects and also
through higher reuse of software components that are useful
for multiple projects [1].
This paper proposes a method comprising a series of
stages with associated techniques for achieving a high degree
of automation and reuse in the development of Web software
projects.
